# React Recipe Generator

A simple React web application that uses the **Claude API** to generate recipes based on the ingredients provided by the user. This project was built as part of the **Scrimba** course "Learn React."

## Features

- Input a list of ingredients.
- Request a recipe suggestion from the Claude API.
- Clean and minimalistic UI built with React.

## Known Issues

- The generated recipe does not appear due to authentication and security issues with the Claude API.
- Requires a well-structured backend to function properly.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **API:** Claude API (currently facing authentication/security issues)

## Potential Fixes & Improvements

- Implement a secure backend to handle API authentication.
- Use a proxy server to avoid direct frontend API requests.
- Add error handling for failed API responses.
